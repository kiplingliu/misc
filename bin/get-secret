### Part 1: One-Time Setup

You only need to do these steps once.

#### 1\. Create a GPG Key (If you don't have one)

If you don't already have a GPG key, generate one. The passphrase for this key will be the **"shorter password"** you want to use.

```bash
gpg --full-generate-key
```

Follow the prompts. RSA (sign and encrypt) with a 4096-bit key size is a strong choice. When asked for a passphrase, enter the shorter, memorable password you want to use for your shell sessions.

#### 2\. Configure GPG Agent Caching

You need to tell `gpg-agent` how long to cache your passphrase. For example, to set a 4-hour cache:

```bash
# Create the config directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p ~/.gnupg

# Add cache settings to the agent configuration
echo "default-cache-ttl 14400" >> ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf
echo "max-cache-ttl 14400" >> ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf
```

*(`14400` seconds = 4 hours). You'll need to restart the agent (or your system) for this to take effect: `gpg-connect-agent reloadagent /bye`.*

#### 3\. Encrypt Your KeePassXC Master Password

Now, encrypt your actual KeePassXC master password using the GPG key you just created. Replace `your_gpg_email@example.com` with the email associated with your GPG key.

```bash
# You will be prompted to enter your KeePassXC master password here
gpg --encrypt --armor -r your_gpg_email@example.com > ~/.keepassxc_master.gpg
```

After running this, type your long KeePassXC master password, press `Enter`, and then `Ctrl+D`. This creates a file `~/.keepassxc_master.gpg` containing the encrypted password.
